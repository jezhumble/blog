<p><a title="FLY - GLOBAL MUSIC CULTURE" href="http://www.fly.co.uk/fly/">Fly</a>, an online magazine devoted to world music, has asked me to write a series of articles on Indian classical music (I studied it for my master's degree in ethnomusicology). The <a title="Appreciating Indian Classical Music part one" href="http://www.fly.co.uk/fly/archives/2006/06/appreciating_indian_classical_music_part_one_the_history.html">first one</a>, dealing with its history and context, has just been published.</p>
